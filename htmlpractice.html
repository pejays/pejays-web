        <strong> Isaac Newton </strong> was born on January 14, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. He was known as the most famous and influential mathematician, philosopher, and scientist in all of human history. 
        His achievements in various fields of science, such as physics, mathematics, astronomy, and optics, made him one of the most renowned scientists of all time. 
        Newton’s father died three months before he was born. His mother, Hannah Ayscough Newton, remarried three years after Isaac was born, leaving Isaac with his grandmother while his mother went with her new husband. 
        Newton attended The King’s School in Grantham, where he displayed his exceptional talents in the fields of science and mathematics. 
        Fast-forward: Newton later enrolled at Trinity College in Cambridge during 1661, which made him more exceptional and helped him develop his creativity, which led to his groundbreaking works. 
        Newton’s greatest contribution starts under the apple tree. It all began when Newton was sitting under the apple tree when a fruit later dropped onto his head, leading him to the discovery of gravity.
        Later on, he develops the three laws of motion, mainly the laws of inertia, acceleration, and action-reaction. Other than that, he is also famous for his work on universal gravitation as well as for discovering calculus, 
        which remains a great foundation in the field of engineering and the branch of mathematics. Newton was also famous for his experiments with light and prisms, which led to the development of his theory of color. 
        This significant discovery of his opens a whole new world for the invention of modern technologies and refines our understanding in the fields of mathematics, physics, and astronomy. 
        As Newton was aging, he passed away on March 31, 1727, in London, England, at the age of 84.
